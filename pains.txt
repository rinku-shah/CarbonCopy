1.
Same elected id issue between local and remote controller -
  Change the file P4RuntimeClientImpl.java in remote controller. File Path : ~/onos/protocols/p4runtime/ctl/src/main/java/org/onosproject/p4runtime/ctl
  Modified file is in onos_controller/ directory of this project.

2.
Make sure to connect both the Controllers before working.

3.
For some reason setting egress_spec is not sufficient. We have to change IP and MAC adresses manually in the p4 code.
There should be some solution to this? NO

4.
Arijit Make proper scapy files which can directly run and which can directly test if the reply packet is received back.

5.
Filter out packets in controller. Filtering by protocol UDP (doesn't work), so filter by src ip Address = 192.168.100.100

6.
Malformed WRITE_REPLY packets handled by byte array constructs in MyTunnelApp.java

7. https://github.com/p4lang/p4factory/issues/159
Use ./sswitch_CLI for adding mirroring_add 500 2

8. setting egress_Spec doesn't work in egress pipeline
