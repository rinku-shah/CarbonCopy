Secondary port number is hardcoded for now.
Can be changed by using a table.
  Todo - Create Table, Action and add entry on startup via controller
Or change it to a constant defined in a file.

Assumption - Packets received from secondary are always to go to gateway. Needed for sync
if(standard_metadata.ingress_port = 2){
    egressSpec_t temp = 1;
    standard_metadata.egress_spec = temp;
    return;
}
